# AWS Route 53 subdomain module

This module creates an AWS S3 bucket and Route 53 A record to redirect traffic from a subdomain URL to a GitHub Pages URL.

It is a companion repository to the [HCP Waypoint get started collection](https://developer.hashicorp.com/waypoint/tutorials/hcp-waypoint) and is meant to work with the [GitHub static app module](https://github.com/hashicorp-education/terraform-github-static-app).
